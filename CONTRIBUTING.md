# Contributing to Stoichify
This project is open and free to the public. Anyone can modify Stoichify to their needs in forksâ€¦ However, if you feel that you've improved Stoichify, in any way, that'll benefit others, please feel free to make a pull request! Just inform the public of what you changed, why, and a demonstration of it in action. If you also have credentials, pertaining to any study of chemistry, feel free to add that as well! 

All pull requests will be reviewed and tested, by Nathan Parker to ensure all additions are safe, and don't affect the pre-existing code base. Your knowledge and dedication to Stoichify not only helps the development, but the impact of others, around the world.
