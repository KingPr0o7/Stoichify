<h1 align="center">Stoichify - The Stoichiometry Solver</h1>

A Python-powered logical system and GUI application designed to solve stoichiometric equations, by breaking down each step as you would write them on a piece of paper. Thus building the needed knowledge ‚Äî all for free. Stoichify is open-source and aimed at chemistry students and teachers to learn and better their experience with the daunting complexity of stoichiometry.

## Versions

### `v1.0.0`
The initial release of Stoichify, being a Computer Science II project, being a command-line interface (CLI) application only solving mole-mole equations. 

### `v2.0.0`
Done for a college project at Ivy Tech, where Stoichify is now a GUI application, designed for beginner chemistry students/teachers to understand the calculations, written out like someone would on a piece of paper. Using Tkinter and other libraries to compile an easily navigable GUI for all.

## Installation
1. Download ZIP *(and unzip)*
2. Navigate to the highest sub folder *(Stoichify-Main/Stoichify-Main (if unzipped and not altered))*
3. Open in Preferred Editor
4. Download Python `3.12` (https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCVDN91XZQP?ocid=pdpshare)
5. If you're using Visual Studio Code *(VSC)* install the Python Extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
6. Run the following commands (**install needed libraries**):
	- `pip install sv-ttk` # Tkinter Theme (Sun Valley)
	- `pip install pillow` # Python Images
	- `pip install sympy` # Symbolic Mathematics
	- `pip install chemlib` # Chemistry Library
7. **Close** and **Reopen** your editor to refresh variables and to get rid of any *"module could not be resolved from source"*
	- If you still have this error, try appending `-v` to the end of a command to see if it's installed.
8. Navigate to `main.py`
9. Click 'Run' or execute command `python main.py` in your terminal in the root location.
10. Wait for the window to open, and enjoy the power of **Stoichify**.
